Instructions
YOU MUST SUBMIT the confirmation page with a clear and legible barcode at the time of your interview. If you do not have access to
a printer at this time, select the option to email your confirmation page to an email address. You may print or email your application for
your own records. YOU DO NOT need to submit the application at the time of the interview.
Please note that you will be required to provide proof that you have paid the visa application fee and any other fees associated with your
application. There may be other fees associated with the visa application process. Please check your country's Reciprocity Schedule for
any other fees you may owe.
If you have further questions, or to find out how to contact the Consular Post, please go to https://hn.usembassy.gov/es/visas-es/ or
http://travel.state.gov.
NOTE: Unless exempt from an interview, you will be required to sign your application by providing a biometric signature, i.e. your
fingerprint before a consular officer. By providing this biometric signature you are certifying under penalty of perjury that you have read
and understood the questions in your nonimmigrant visa application and that all statements that appear in your nonimmigrant visa
application have been made by you and are true and complete to the best of your knowledge and belief. Furthermore at the time of your
interview, you will be required to certify under penalty of perjury that all statements in your application and those made during your
interview are true and compete to the best of your knowledge and belief.
You electronically signed your application on 23-Aug-2022 01:13:07 (GMT-05:00). You were required to electronically sign your
application yourself, unless otherwise exempt by regulation, even if the application was prepared by someone other than yourself. Your
electronic signature certifies that you have read and understood the questions in this application and that your answers are true and
correct to the best of your knowledge and belief. The submission of an application containing any false or misleading statements may
result in the permanent refusal of a visa or the denial of entry into the United States. All declarations made in this application are
unsworn declarations made under penalty of perjury. (28 U.S.C. 1746).
You certified that you understand that you are required to submit your visa to the United States Immigration Officer at the port where
you apply to enter the United States, and that possession of the visa does not entitle you to enter the United States if, upon your
arrival, you are found to be inadmissible under U.S. immigration laws. You certified that you understand that any willfully false or
misleading statement or willful concealment of a material fact made by you within the application may subject you to permanent
exclusion from the United States and, if you are admitted to the United States, may subject you to criminal prosecution and/or
deportation.
The information that you have provided in your application and other information submitted with your application may be accessible to
other government agencies having statutory or other lawful authority to use such information, including for law enforcement and
immigration law enforcement purposes. If fingerprints are collected as part of your application process, they may be used for the
purpose of comparing them to other fingerprints in the FBIâ€™s Next Generation Identification (NGI) fingerprint system or its successor
systems (including civil, criminal, and latent fingerprint repositories). The photograph that you provide with your application may be
used for employment verification or other U.S. law purposes.
